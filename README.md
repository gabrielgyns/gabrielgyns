### Hi there! 😄

My name is Gabriel Silva Soares from Brazil (🇧🇷). I work as a Software Developer at **Devoteam Portugal in an ERIKS Digital**'s project. My studies focus is on the **Front-end**. In my job I'm working directly with React and the Front End ecosystem itself.
🎓 I'm graduated in Information Systems (Bachelor).

In my free time I like to 🎞️ Watch movies and 📺 series, 📚 Read books, 🎵 listen to music, 💻 code (ofc) and ✈️ travel.

Would you like to talk? Feel free to contact me!
