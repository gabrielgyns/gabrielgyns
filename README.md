### Hi there! 😄

My name is Gabriel Silva Soares from Brazil (🇧🇷). I work as a Software Developer at **Aubay Portugal in a Sky UK**'s project called **Peacock**. I am currently focusing my studies on the Front-end. In my job I'm working directly with Front End ecosystem.
🎓 I'm graduated in Information Systems (Bachelor).

I started to study programming when I was 17 years old, since then I'm on this world of coffee ☕ and code 💻.

In my free time I like to 🎞️ Watch movies and 📺 series, 📚 Read books, 🎵 listen to music, 💻 code (ofc) and ✈️ travel.

Would you like to talk to me? Feel free to contact me!
