### Hi there! 👋

My name is Gabriel Soares from Brazil (🇧🇷). I work as a Software Developer since 2018 at Run2biz. I am currently focusing on the Front-end area, working directly with React.
I'm also on my last semester of college 🎓 where I study Information Systems (Sistemas de Informação).

I started to study programming when I was 17 years old, since then I'm on this world of coffee ☕ and code 💻.

In my free time I like to 🎞️ Watch movies and 📺 series, 📚 Read books, 🎵 listen to music, 💻 code (ofc) and ✈️ travel.

Would you like to find me?
